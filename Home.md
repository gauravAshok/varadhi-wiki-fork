## Varadhi

Varadhi is a message bus implementation with a REST interface. Varadhi supports both P2P (point-to-point) and Publish-Subscribe messaging models. The idea behind RESTBus is to take your HTTP API stack and automatically transform them into service bus driven, queued, message oriented endpoints. The communication from Varadhi to the end point will be on HTTP again. The sender will have to include additional headers denoting the target HTTP URL and the HTTP Method to use. Varadhi will use these headers to talk to the receiver.
